# BEFORE YOU BEGIN

Note: Every file in this Repo (except DS100GradProject.ipnyb) is just a csv copied from BasketballReference.com -- They were then imported from this repo to our Google Colab Notebook where we wrote and ran our code.

In other words, DS100GradProject.ipnyb is where all our code is written and run. 


# DESCRIPTION

The objective of this project is to understand what fantasy basketball scores are actually measuring, which factors tend to influence them, and how they can best be predicted. We will do an exploratory data analysis in which we compare the model to advanced player performance statistics in order to understand its meaning, perform a principle component analysis on the metrics that constitute the fantasy points algorithm, and analyze the effect of factors such as home court advantage and opposing defensive strength on its outcomes. Using the insights from our EDA we will form a linear model to predict fantasy basketball scores which will be trained on 2 seasons of game by game data and tested on a third.


# Our Data
All of the data used in this project has been downloaded or webscraped off of basketball-reference.com. We will build our projections by training our model on game-by-game statistics of the top 100 fantasy scorers from the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons, and test it on the top 100 scorers from the 2018-19 season.
